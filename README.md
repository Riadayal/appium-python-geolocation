# How to change IP geographic location in Python with Appium on on [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=appium-python-geoLocation)

While performing app automation testing with appium on LambdaTest Grid, you may face a scenario where you would like to simulate location of a specific country. You can easily do that by using the lambdatest capability "GeoLocation" and refer the 2-letter country code in the automation script. You can refer to sample test repo [here](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-python)

# Steps:

The following is an example on how to set geoLocation in the capabilities.

```
from appium import webdriver
from appium.webdriver.common.mobileby import MobileBy
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
import time
import os

desired_caps = {
    "deviceName":"Galaxy S20",
    "platformName":"Android",
    "platformVersion":"10",
    "app":"lt://", #Enter app_url here
    "isRealMobile":True,
    "build":"Python Vanilla Android",
    "name":"Sample Test - Python",
    "network":True,
    "visual":True,
    "video":True,

    #ADD GEOLOCATION BASED ON COUNTRY CODE
    "geoLocation":"fr"

}

def startingTest():
    if os.environ.get("LT_USERNAME") is None:
        username = "username"  #Enter LT username here if environment variables have not been added
    else:
        username = os.environ.get("LT_USERNAME")
    if os.environ.get("LT_ACCESS_KEY") is None:
        accesskey = "accesskey" #Enter LT accesskey here if environment variables have not been added
    else:
        accesskey = os.environ.get("LT_ACCESS_KEY")
    
    try:
        driver = webdriver.Remote(desired_capabilities=desired_caps, command_executor="https://"+username+":"+accesskey+"@mobile-hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub")
        colorElement = WebDriverWait(driver,20).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((MobileBy.ID,"com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/color")))
        colorElement.click()

        textElement = WebDriverWait(driver,20).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((MobileBy.ID,"com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/Text")))
        textElement.click()

        toastElement = WebDriverWait(driver,20).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((MobileBy.ID,"com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/toast")))
        toastElement.click()

        notification = WebDriverWait(driver,20).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((MobileBy.ID,"com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/notification")))
        notification.click()

        geolocation = WebDriverWait(driver,20).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((MobileBy.ID,"com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/geoLocation")))
        geolocation.click()
        time.sleep(5)

        driver.quit()
    except:
        driver.quit()

startingTest()

```

## Run your test

```bash
python3 android.py
```

Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on the [LambdaTest App Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/build).
